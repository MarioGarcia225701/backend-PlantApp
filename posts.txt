It is a clump-forming evergreen perennial growing to 50 cm (20 in), very similar in appearance to Goeppertia makoyana. The large rounded leaves are dark green above, red below, marked heavily with cream or pink stripes "painted" along the veins and midrib, with feathered margins. 
It is tender, with a minimum temperature of 16 °C (61 °F) required, and in temperate areas is cultivated indoors as a houseplant. It requires a constant temperature of 18–24 °C (64–75 °F), high humidity levels at all times, and bright indirect light. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit as a houseplant.
